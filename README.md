FRC-4121.github.io
==================
A fancy website for our FRC team built using HTML and github pages.

This website has been obsoleted by sites.google.com/view/team4121. 
Hence, I have archived this repository, most likely permanently.
Additionally, I have deleted the master branch, so the website
and domain themselves no longer exist.  If in the future this 
website is to be reactivated, the master branch will need to
be recreated.
